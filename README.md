# CMS025_PRINCESS

This is a secondary analysis of an RCT that aimed to look at the effects of a daily oral probiotic on antibiotic requirement/rate of infection in UK care homes. Here we sequenced the microbiome at baseline and at three months in both arms of the trial (placebo and probiotic) to see how the microbiome varies as a function of antibiotic exposure and treatment arm.
